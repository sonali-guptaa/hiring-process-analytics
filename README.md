# hiring-process-analytics
I am doing an analysis of a company's hiring process data to draw meaningful insights from it like the number of rejections, interviews, job types, and vacancies. I am also doing statistical analysis to provide informations like the gender distribution of hires like how many males and females were hired by the company, average salary offered by the company, salary distribution, proportion of people working in different departments through visualizations like pie chart or bar graph and distribution of positions across different tiers through chart or graph.
